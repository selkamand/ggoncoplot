    abstract = {Abstract Heatmap is a widely used statistical visualization method on
    matrix-like data to reveal similar patterns shared by subsets of rows and
    columns. In the R programming language, there are many packages that make
    heatmaps. Among them, the ComplexHeatmap package provides the richest toolset
    for constructing highly customizable heatmaps. ComplexHeatmap can easily
    establish connections between multisource information by automatically
    concatenating and adjusting a list of heatmaps as well as complex
    annotations, which makes it widely applied in data analysis in many fields,
    especially in bioinformatics, to find hidden structures in the data. In this
    article, we give a comprehensive introduction to the current state of
    ComplexHeatmap, including its modular design, its rich functionalities, and
    its broad applications.
