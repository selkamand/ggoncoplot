\f0\fs24 \cf0 This document describes the dataset created for testing, that includes all possible edge-cases I could think of
\f1\b \
\
============ simulated_mutations.tsv ============
\f0\b0 \
3 column, mutation level dataset with columns describing 
\f1\b Samples, Genes & VariantType
\f0\b0 \
\
Features include\
1) 10 samples (Sample A-I)\
2) Mutations in 20 different genes + 1 IGR mutation in SampleB lacking a gene name (\'93\'94)\
3) Sample-Gene pairs that have been mutated twice. Including but not limited to:\
	i) SampleA ABCB1 has 2 mutations, each with different mutation types\
	ii) SampleA AKT1 has 2 mutations, both with the same mutation type (3\'92UTR)\
\

\f1\b Missing Data:
\f0\b0 \
4) 1 gene, NFE2L2, that 
\f1\b \ul NEVER
\f0\b0 \ulnone  has its VariantType Described (should still appear in Oncoplot!)\
5) 1 IGR mutation in SampleB lacking a gene name (\'93\'94)\
6) 1 EGFR intronic variant missing a sample id\
7) A mutation in SampleE missing Both Gene and VariantType\
8) A mutation in SampleE missing Samples,Genes and VariantType\
\

\f1\b ============ simulated_mutations.clinical.tsv ============\

\f0\b0 \
simulated_mutations.clinical.tsv has the following features\
\
1) every type of clinical feature (numeric/categorical/logical/numeric_that_should_probably_be_logical\
\
2) Names of columns that are ugly and of non-uniform type (to test beautify)\
\
3) All samples in mutation dataset, except 1 (Sample H) and also technically the empty Sample name (\'93\'94) - see (6)\
 Above\
\
4) 2 additional samples not described in mutational data (Sample X & Sample Z)\
\
5) Missing data in every type of feature\
\
6) Several ZERO values in numeric features\
\
7) Inf and -Inf values for numerics\
\
6) Missing (\'93\'94) and explicitly missing (NA) values for all types}
