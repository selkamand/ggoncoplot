\f0\fs24 \cf0 This document describes the dataset created for testing, that includes all possible edge-cases I could think of
\f1\b \
\
============ simulated_mutations.tsv ============
\f0\b0 \
3 column, mutation level dataset with columns describing 
\f1\b Samples, Genes & VariantType
\f0\b0 \
\
Features include\
1) 10 samples (Sample A-I)\
2) Mutations in 21 different genes + 1 IGR mutation in SampleB lacking a gene name (\'93\'94)\
3) Sample-Gene pairs that have been mutated twice. Including but not limited to:\
	i) SampleA ABCB1 has 2 mutations, each with different mutation types\
	ii) SampleA AKT1 has 2 mutations, both with the same mutation type (3\'92UTR)\
\

\f1\b Missing Data:
\f0\b0 \
4) 1 gene, NFE2L2, that 
\f1\b \ul NEVER
\f0\b0 \ulnone  has its VariantType Described (all set to NA) (should still appear in Oncoplot!)\
4.1) 1 gene, EMPTY, that 
\f1\b \ul NEVER
\f0\b0 \ulnone  has its VariantType Described (all set to \'94\'94) (should still appear in Oncoplot!)\
5) 1 IGR mutation in SampleB lacking a gene name (\'93\'94)\
5.1) 1 Missense_Mutation in SampleB lacking a gene name (\'93\'94)\
6) 1 EGFR intronic variant missing a sample id\
7) A mutation in SampleE missing Both Gene and VariantType\
8) A mutation in SampleE missing Samples,Genes and VariantType\
\

\f1\b ============ simulated_mutations.clinical.tsv ============\

\f0\b0 \
simulated_mutations.clinical.tsv has the following features\
\
1) every type of clinical feature (numeric/categorical/logical/numeric_that_should_probably_be_logical\
\
2) Names of columns that are ugly and of non-uniform type (to test beautify)\
\
3) All samples in mutation dataset, except 1 (Sample H) and also technically the empty Sample name (\'93\'94) - see (6)\
 Above\
\
4) 2 additional samples not described in mutational data (Sample X & Sample Z)\
\
6) Several ZERO values in numeric features\
\
7) Inf and -Inf values for numerics\
\
8) Missing (\'93\'94) and explicitly missing (NA) values for all types\
\
9 Duplicate Sample (
\f2 SampleB)\
\

\f1\b ============ simulated_mutations.clinical.tsv ============\

\f0\b0 Map 15 genes to 3 different pathways.\
\
The remaining 6 genes are not linked.to any pathway - and should be automatically grouped as \'91Other\'92 \
\
\
===========
\f1\b  \'91valid\'92 versions of each files ===========\

\f0\b0 For actually testing the oncoplot scripts - we need \'91valid\'92 versions of the above files, which do not have invalid properties that will make ggoncoplot to throw errors. The process of generating these form the invalid files is in
